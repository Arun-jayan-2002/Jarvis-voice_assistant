- Battery status: Reports the battery percentage and charging status.
- Sending WhatsApp messages: Allows the user to send WhatsApp messages via voice commands.
- Date and time: Provides the current date and time on command.
- Open applications: Can open web browsers, notepad, Spotify, and other applications.
- Entertainment: Can tell jokes and play songs from YouTube.
- Voice customization: Allows the user to switch between male and female voices.

## Getting Started

1. Install the required Python libraries using the following command:
    pip install PYQT5
   , pip install pyttsx3
   , pip install speech_recognition
   , pip install Date time
   , pip install OS
   , pip install wikipedia
   , pip install web browser
   , pip install requests
   , pip install bs4
   , pip install psutil
   , pip install pywhatkit
